All the commands used in linux is in bin.

cd /  -> to go to root
cd [path]

mkdir -p "folder1/folder2/folder3" -> this creates nested directories (-p -> path)

touch .filename -> creates a hidden file

ls -a -> shows all files including hidden files

ls -A -> to show all files including hidden files without directory files(. or ..)

ls -l -> shows all files line by line with size

su root ->its usde to give current user super user role 

exit -> its used to get out of super user

two types of path->
1. Relative path -> path related to current path
2. Absolute path -> path starting from root

to check all variation of command use [command] --help

to clear use clear

shortcuts
1. to open terminal -> ctrl + alt + t
2. to close terminal-> ctrl + d

#############################
~ -> user 
/home -> home
/ -> root 
#############################

1. /bin -> contails all the files for commands

2. /sbin-> contails all commands which are used for changing system properties.
basically used to modify users.

3. /boot -> The contents are mostly Linux kernel files and bootloaderfiles(files needed to start up the operating system) 

4. /dev -> This contains device files 

This file represents your speaker device,keyboard 

5. /etc -> 
it contains all system related configuration files in here or in its sub-directories 
A "configuration file" is defined as a local file used to control the operation of a program; 
it cannot be an executable binary. 
Ex:-adduser.conf, theme config 

6. /cdrom -> 
directory is a standard practice to mount cd, but not necessary. We use media and mnt to mount anything these days 
In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, /cdrom is commonly used as the default directory where the contents of a CD or DVD inserted into the computer's optical drive are mounted. 
When you insert a CD or DVD, the system may automatically mount it to the /cdrom directory (or it could be mounted manually). 
You can view the contents of the disc by navigating to this directory in the terminal. 

7. /home->
The home directory can be said as a personal working space for all the users except root.  
There is a separate directory for every user. 
For example, two users ‘ansh' and ‘kaemi' will have directories like "/home/ansh“ and "/home/kaemi“

8 ./lib :- 
The /lib directory contains shared libraries and kernel modules that are necessary to boot and run the system.  
These libraries are used by essential system binaries located in directories like /bin and /sbin. 
Shared libraries are files that contain code or data that multiple programs can use simultaneously.  
Instead of having the same code duplicated in every executable, the system allows programs to load a shared library into memory when they need it. This improves efficiency and saves disk space. 
The shared libraries in /lib are generally required by programs in /bin (basic user commands) and /sbin (system administration commands). Without these shared libraries, programs might fail to run 
Difference between lib, lib32, lib64, libx32 

lib :-architecture independent files. 

lib32 :-for 32 bit architecture libraries 

lib64 :-for 64 bit architecture libraries 

libx32 :-for 64 bit architecture libraries but the pointer size is 32 bit, 

Normally software using the x86-64 instruction set uses 64-bit pointer size.

9. /media :- 
When you connect a removable media such as USB disk, SD card or DVD, a directory is automatically created under the /media directory for them. You can access the content of the removable media from this directory. 

 
10. /mnt – 
Mount directoryThis is similar to the /media directory but instead of automatically mounting the removable media, mnt is used by system administrators to manually mount a filesystem 
mounting refers to the process of making a filesystem accessible to the operating system's directory structure. It is essentially the act of attaching an external storage device (like a hard drive, USB stick, or CD-ROM) or a remote filesystem to a specific location (a directory) within the main filesystem. 

11. /opt – 
Optional softwareTraditionally, the /opt directory is used for installing/storing the files of third-party applications that are not available from the distribution’s repository. 
In the old days, "/opt" was used by UNIX vendors like AT&T, Sun, DEC and 3rd-party vendors to hold "Option" packages; i.e. packages that you might have paid extra money for. 

12. /proc :- 
It contains useful information about the processes that are currently running.It could be used for obtaining information about a system, we can also edit the config files related to kernel here. 

 
13. /root :- 
it works as the home directory of the root user. So instead of /home/root, the home of root is located at /root. root directory (/) is different from root user directory. 

 
14. /tmp :- 
this directory holds temporary files. Many applications use this directory to store temporary files. Even you can use directory to store temporary files. 
the contains of the /tmp directories are deleted when your system restarts. Some Linux system also delete files old files automatically so don’ store anything important here. 

 

15. /var :- 
stores system-generated variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, cache, transient and temporary files. 
Ex :-/var/spool contains data which is awaiting some kind of later processing/run :-runtime variable data. 
The purposes of this directory were once served by /var/run, system may use both 

16 /srv :- 
This directory gives users the location of data files for a particular service. 
For example, if you run a HTTP or FTP server, it’s a good practice to store the website data in the /srv directory. 

 
17 /usr :-  
User System Resources. in ‘/usr’ go all the executable files, libraries, source of most of the system programs.  
For this reason, most of the files contained therein is readonly (for the normal user). 


18 /sys :- 
allows you to get information about the system and its components (mostly attached and installed hardware) in a structured way. 
Ex:-device, kernel, firmware 

 
19 /snap :- 
The /snap directory is, by default, where the files and folders from installed snap packages appear on your system.

Various options of ls Command: 

1) ls 
It will display all files and directories according to alphabetical order of names. 

 

2) ls -r 
It will display all files and directories in reverse of aplhabetical order. 


3) ls | more 
To display content line by line 
(To come out we have to use q) 

 

4)ls -l 
To display long listing of files 

 

5) ls -t 
To display all files based on last modified date and time. Most recent is at top and old 
are at bottom. 

6) ls -rt 
To display all files based on reverse of last modified date and time. Old files are at top 
and recent files are at bottom. 

7) ls -a 
a means all 
To display all files including hidden files. Here . and .. also will be displayed. 

8) ls -A 
A means almost all 
To display all files including hidden files except . and .. 

9) ) ls -h 
display in human readable format 

10) ls -R 
R means Recursive. 
It will list all files and directories including sub directory contents also. By default ls 
will display only direct contents but not sub directory contents.
